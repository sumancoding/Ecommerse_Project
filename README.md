We're creating a authentication with a Dashboard in one of the dummy ecommerce website. We have basic navigation routes for home, contact and Login/Registration.
The entire work has been created in Login/Registration Tab.

Customer can register or the login, this directs to dashboard where nformation can be edited .
validations has been used so that nothing wrong info doen't passes through
Alert tab from MUI has been used to signify success/failure.
State has been managed by FormData and Data accessed by get method.

npx json-server --port=3001 --watch db.json -->
